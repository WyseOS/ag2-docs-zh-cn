Thus, there has been significant research work in AI agents that\\\\ninteract with the internet through web browsing. However, there is also another\\\\ninterface designed specifically for machine interaction with online content:\\\\napplication programming interfaces (APIs). In this paper we ask -- what if we\\\\nwere to take tasks traditionally tackled by browsing agents, and give AI agents\\\\naccess to APIs? To do so, we propose two varieties of agents: (1) an\\\\nAPI-calling agent that attempts to perform online tasks through APIs only,\\\\nsimilar to traditional coding agents, and (2) a Hybrid Agent that can interact\\\\nwith online data through both web browsing and APIs. In experiments on\\\\nWebArena, a widely-used and realistic benchmark for web navigation tasks, we\\\\nfind that API-based agents outperform web browsing agents. Hybrid Agents\\\\nout-perform both others nearly uniformly across tasks, resulting in a more than\\\\n20.0% absolute improvement over web browsing alone, achieving a success rate of\\\\n35.8%, achiving the SOTA performance among task-agnostic agents. These results\\\\nstrongly suggest that when APIs are available, they present an attractive\\\\nalternative to relying on web browsing alone.\\', \\'pdf_url\\': \\'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.16464v1\\'}, {\\'title\\': \\'Predicting the Impact of Generative AI Using an Agent-Based Model\\', \\'authors\\': [\\'Joao Tiago Aparicio\\', \\'Manuela Aparicio\\', \\'Sofia Aparicio\\', \\'Carlos J.

These agents are designed to interact with users through web interfaces, often using natural language processing and machine learning techniques. Below is an overview of the recent literature exploring various facets of AI web agents, including their technological foundations, applications, and challenges.\\n\\n### 1. Conversational Agents in Healthcare\\n\\nResearch by Laranjo et al. (2018) highlights the burgeoning role of AI-based conversational agents in healthcare, specifically in managing chronic conditions. As detailed in their systematic review, published in the Journal of Medical Internet Research, these agents provide continuous support and engagement for patients, playing a crucial role in the self-management of chronic diseases. The study underscores the agents’ ability to handle patient queries, offer reminders for medication adherence, and provide educational content, thereby enhancing patient care and reducing healthcare costs (Laranjo et al., 2018).\\n\\n### 2. AI-Powered Conversational Agents\\n\\nA comprehensive review by Pereira and Diaz (2023) examines the integration of AI in conversational agents across various sectors. Published in the Journal of Business Research, this review compiles work indexed in Web of Science and Scopus, concentrating on the advancements and challenges in developing robust AI conversational systems. Key takeaways highlight the increasing adoption of machine learning algorithms to facilitate human-like interaction, improve decision-making processes, and deliver personalized user experiences (Pereira & Diaz, 2023).\\n\\n### 3. Web 3.0 and AI Integration\\n\\nThe potential of Web 3.0 technologies, particularly AI, 5G, and blockchain, as explored by Zhang et al. (2023), cannot be overstated. This paper discusses how these technologies collectively redefine web interactions, offering novel opportunities while presenting significant challenges. The integration of AI within Web 3.0 infrastructure enhances connectivity and personalization, though it raises concerns regarding data privacy and security (Zhang et al., 2023).\\n\\n### 4. API-Based AI Web Agents\\n\\nIn an innovative approach, Santoro et al. (2023) propose API-based web agents, which differ from traditional web browsers by utilizing APIs to enhance task efficiency. Their study presents these API-based agents as outclassing conventional web browser methods in navigation tasks, suggesting a shift towards more efficient and robust task completion strategies (Santoro et al., 2023).\\n\\n### 5. Societal Impact of Generative AI\\n\\nThe societal impacts of generative AI, especially as modeled in educational and regulatory domains, are significant, as discussed by D'Cruze et al. (2023). This study uses agent-based models to predict the transformative effects of AI on creative processes and industry standards. The research highlights not only the economic benefits but also the potential societal challenges that come with widespread AI adoption (D'Cruze et al., 2023).\\n\\n### 6. Trust and Ethical Considerations in AI\\n\\nFinally, the issue of trust in AI systems is critically assessed by Lee et al. (2023), focusing on how trust influences human-machine interactions. This paper presents a taxonomy for evaluating AI trustworthiness, addressing technical and ethical considerations crucial for the acceptance and success of AI web agents (Lee et al., 2023).\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nThe development of AI web agents continues to advance rapidly, with significant potential benefits across various industries. From healthcare to enhanced web navigation, these agents promise efficiency and improved user engagement. However, challenges such as ensuring privacy, establishing user trust, and managing ethical considerations remain pivotal. Future research is likely to focus on overcoming these hurdles to harness the full capabilities of AI web agents.\\n\\n### References\\n\\nLaranjo, L., Dunn, A. G., Tong, H. L., Kocaballi, A.
